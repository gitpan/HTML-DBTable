Installation note for HTML::DBTable.
====================================

To install this module

# perl Makefile.PL
# make
# make test
# make install

MySQL note.
===========

This module use the DBIx::DBSchema module to get DB schema. 
But DBIx::DBSchema version 0.22 doesn't know "ENUM" MySQL type and so, 
this module (and DBIx::DBSchema too) doesn't work with MySQL table 
that have "ENUM" fields in its.

I notify this bugs to DBIx::DBSchema owner but, untill he doesn't have
time to patch its module, you can apply my patch

DBIx_DBSchema_with_enum.patch

manually to DBIx::DBSchema. 

Install DBIx::DBschema and then execute this command

patch -P1 < DBIx_DBSchema_with_enum.patch 

in the directory where DBIx::DBSchema is installed (for example this
directory is /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/DBIx/DBSchema on my system).
