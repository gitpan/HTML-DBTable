Installation note for HTML::DBTable.
====================================

To install this module

# perl Makefile.PL
# make
# make test
# make install

DBIx::DBSchema note.
===========

This module use the DBIx::DBSchema module to get DB schema. 
But DBIx::DBSchema version 0.22 doesn't know "ENUM" MySQL type and so, 
this module (and DBIx::DBSchema too) doesn't work with MySQL table 
that have "ENUM" fields in its.

I notify this bug to DBIx::DBSchema owner but, untill he doesn't have
time to patch its module, you can apply my patch

DBIx_DBSchema_with_enum.patch

manually to DBIx::DBSchema. 

Install DBIx::DBschema and then execute this command

patch -P1 < DBIx_DBSchema_with_enum.patch 

in the directory where DBIx::DBSchema is installed (for example this
directory is /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.0/DBIx/DBSchema on my system).

If you use CPAN module to install DBIx::DBSchema version 0.22 you can be
frustrating by the fact that this module doesn't install owing to test
errors. I'm apologized about this problem by this module isn't mine.
You can bypass this forcing installation with the command

cpan> force install DBIx::DBSchema

I have see no problem with this.
